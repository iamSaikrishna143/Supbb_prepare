// Node.js Interview Preparation hashtag#part7 !!

// What is Express.js?
// Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the creation of web servers and APIs.

// What are the main features of Express.js?
// Routing
// Middleware support
// Template engines integration
// HTTP utility methods
// Quick API creation

// How do you create a basic Express.js server?
// You create a basic Express server by requiring the express module, creating an app instance, and defining routes for handling HTTP requests.

// What is middleware in Express.js?
// Middleware in Express.js refers to functions that have access to the request, response, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware can modify the request/response or end the request-response cycle.

// How do you handle route parameters in Express.js?
// Route parameters are used to capture values in the URL path. You can access them via req.params.

// What is the role of next() in Express.js?
// The next() function is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. If no middleware function is defined after, it passes control to the route handler.

// How do you serve static files in Express.js?
// You can serve static files using express.static() middleware, which specifies the folder containing static files like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript.

// How do you handle POST data in Express.js?
// Use express.json() or express.urlencoded() middleware to parse JSON or URL-encoded data sent in the body of a POST request.

// What is routing in Express.js?
// Routing refers to defining how the application should respond to client requests to specific endpoints (URLs) and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
